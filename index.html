    <h5 class="card-title">What?</h5>
    <p class="card-texts2 card-text">Guide to the 21st Century is a 4-week online general-ed program with an 8 course curriculum, a book, and a community of learners.
<br>
<br>
Collectively covering the essential topics for life today, a series of self-analysis writting programs, and pedagogy that makes learning easy. </p>

  </div>

    </div>

    <div class="card mid-col cards2">
<div class="card-body">
<h5 class="card-title">Why?</h5>

<p class="card-text card-texts2">We believe every person must have a foundational knowledge base to succeed in life.
<br>
<br>
We thought school would provide us with one... it didn’t. Consequently, we decided to make one ourselves.
<br>
<br>

It turned out to be better than expected, so we decided to share it with the world.</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class="card cards2">
<div class="card-body">
<h5 class="card-title">Where?</h5>
<p class="card-texts2 card-text">It’s all online. You can do it anywhere.</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class="card cards2">
<div class="card-body">
<h5 class="card-title">When?</h5>
<p class="card-texts2 card-text">You can begin as soon as you enroll, or later -- you get lifetime access.
  <br>
  <br>

BUT, you must decide to start. If even 1% of you doesn’t want to do it, then don’t. Better to wait until you‘re ready.
</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class="card mid-col cards2">
<div class="card-body">
<h5 class="card-title">How?</h5>
<p class="card-texts2 card-text">Watch the videos, answer the questions, trust the process, and see the world with new eyes.
  <br>
  <br>

If you’re really ambitious, you can go through the material in less than a week.
</p>

</div>

<div class="card cards2">
<div class="card-body">
<h5 class="card-title">Who?</h5>
<p class="card-texts2 card-text">It’s meant to be a High School graduation gift because we wish we had it then.
  <br>
  <br>

However, it can be incredibly powerful for anyone alive today. </p>

<div class="card-header">The Story of Everything</div>
<div class="card-body">

  <p class="card-text">
Considering the future always holds a strong resemblance to the past, it’s crucial to know where we’ve come from if we wish to get to where we want to go.
<Br>
<br>
So, here we cover everything from the birth of the Universe to the happenings of the distant future.</p>
</div>

    <br>
    <br>


Learn about the true nature of money, taxes, assets, liabilites, debt and all the other financial fundamentals that you cannot  live without.

<div class="card-header">Navigating the New World</div>
<div class="card-body">

  <p class="card-text">
Technology is intertwined with our lives and the bond will only strengthen as we move into the future.
<br>
<br>

 Therefore, it’s critical to understand it such that you enhance yourself rather than be enslaved by it.
 <br>
 <br>

<div class="card-header">The Study of Thought</div>
<div class="card-body">

  <p class="card-text">In a world rapidly evolving, your internal world - the mind - must be in a state of balance if becoming the victim is to be avoided; this helps in all facets of life.
<br><br>
We believe an understanding of the Science behind human emotions and the human mind is the solution. In other words, Emotional Intelegence and Psychology.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class=" cards3 card text-white bg-dark mb-3">
<div class="card-header">The Study of Knowledge</div>
<div class="card-body">

  <p class="card-text">Information is everywhere, with it, complexity.
    <br>
    <br>

And It’s our inability to understand complexity that prevents us to make sense of life and make any kind of progress.
<br>
<br>

So, here we will cover logical fallacies, the different perspectives of life, the unanswered questions of the universe, and so on. In other words, the true essence of Philosophy.</p>

<div class="card-header">How We Organize Ourselves</div>
<div class="card-body">

  <p class="card-text">
Politics defines the environment we live in.
<br>
<br>

It defines the rules within which we can pursue our hopes and dreams.
<br>
<br>

Need I say more?
<br>
<br>

Here, we definitely don’t give any political opinions, but provide a description of the political landscape, how it works, how it came to be, etc.</p>
